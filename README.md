# Christmas shopping list

For my application I chose Vue.js for the frontend and Express/Node.js for backend.
I'm also using in-memory array to store my gifts and perform CRUD operations on it.
I used try/catch on my operations for consistency in backend and also to display errors in frontend.

For frontend I'm using component-level logic, this is because for me its easier to follow, organize and maintain code. 
I'm displaying the gifts in cards and added a filtering for purchased/not purchased gifts.

Enjoy!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to frontend in your terminal and run "npm install". Do the same for backend.
3. Now run "npm run dev" in both the frontend and backend folder to start the application.
